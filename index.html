		<p>Welcome one, welcome all to this mirror mirror on the wall.  You've fallen down the rabbit hole and come to play a game.  I have to tell you, we don't get vistors often...  We don't usually let people see our lovely land, but maybe if you win our little game we can let you stay.</p>
	</section>
	<section id="how-to">
		<p>
			Well since you insist on staying, we figure we'll at least tell you how to play our little game.  There's a box filled with 16 squares, each one is a picture and has a match somewhere in the box.  Flip over a square and try to find its mate by flipping over another square.  Play until you win.
		</p>
		<p>
			We'll show you how long you've been playing, how many mistakes you've made, how many matches you got right and how long you have to go.  If you win, we'll let you know if you get to stay...
